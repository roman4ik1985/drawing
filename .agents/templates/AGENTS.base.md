# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
Base operating rules for a new project initialized from the Codex project template.

## Default Project Structure
- `raw/sources/` — immutable source materials
- `raw/web-clipped/` — captured web materials
- `raw/assets/` — images and attachments
- `wiki/entities/` — entities
- `wiki/concepts/` — concepts
- `wiki/sources/` — source summaries
- `wiki/synthesis/` — analysis, handoffs, and working notes
- `wiki/index.md` — wiki entrypoint
- `wiki/log.md` — append-only operation log

## Core Rules
1. Do not edit existing files in `raw/*` except to add new source files.
2. Keep `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/log.md` current.
3. Use Obsidian links like `[[...]]` between wiki pages when the project uses the wiki structure.
4. Keep `AGENTS.md` for long-lived rules, not one-off task notes.

## Logging Policy
1. After each substantive user request, append a short operation entry to `wiki/log.md`.
2. Each entry should include:
   - operation type (`query`, `implementation`, `config`, `handoff`, `lint`, `ingest`)
   - touched files
   - short result summary
3. If the project has `scripts/append-wiki-log.ps1`, use it as the canonical logger.
4. Otherwise use UTF-8 safe append/write commands.

## Handoff Policy
1. Before switching branch, archiving a long thread, or moving a contour into a new chat, prepare a short handoff.
2. The minimal handoff should include:
   - goal
   - what is already done
   - next step
   - key files
3. If the chat becomes too large or too mixed and that starts hurting accuracy or speed, recommend moving to a new chat.
4. Canonical extraction command: `вынеси в новый чат:`

## Next-Step Format
1. When proposing next steps, separate:
   - `Что именно (steps, budget)`
   - `Минимальный scope (steps, budget)`
2. In those labels, write exactly two numbers in parentheses:
   - number of steps
   - percent of a 5-hour budget
3. Right after those lines, add a short breakdown through slices/packages or numbered items.
